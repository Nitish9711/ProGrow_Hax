## About

ProGrow is a versatile and Go-To online platform for all the Farmers and Contractors out there. We simplify the process of finding a buyer for your produced goods as well as finding farmers for any contract. We are on a mission to make the farming system more transparent and provide an easy interface for all your needs by making the farming services accessible to all and on-demand for every need.

Given the current farmer's problem, We have created a curated online platform that connects farmers to all the contractors. We are a one-stop platform for all types of farmers and contractors thereby curbing all the worries which are in the mind of every farmer.

Our motivation behind this idea was itself contract-based farming and it includes all the necessary features associated with it.
